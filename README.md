# Hello Fellas,

Coding in my opinion is like an art that teaches how we think, communicate and solve problems, of course my opinion can be different from other people's opinions, how about you ?

Outside of coding, I like to hang out with friends for coffee or a glass of beer hehe. don't forget to accompany it with a pack of cigarettes, because for me there are no cigarettes so there is no inspiration hahahaha. Besides that, I like to joke, whatever the joke is, remember that we are humans, not robots, we need socialization
